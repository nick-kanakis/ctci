    *  A & B == 0 only when A =~B (there is no position in A and B that have 1s
    *
    *  Since A = n & B = n-1 the only way that the above equation is true is when n has only one 1
    *  eg: n = 1 = 1
    *      n = 10 = 2
    *      n = 100 = 4
    *      n = 10000 = 8
    *      n = 100000 = 16
    *      n = 1000000 = 32
    *      ....
    *
    *  So this code checks if n is a power of 2
