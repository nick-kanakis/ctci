First we need to address the issue with the circular array.
    - This is being done by using a head pointer to be used as the start of the array.

Then you must implement the Iterator interface.
    - First on CircularArray, class implement the Iterable Interface, which require a iterator() method.
    This method returns a new instance of Iterator.
    - The CircularArrayIterator implements the Iterator, this objects instance must be returned from iterator method above.
    The Iterator interface requires the following methods: boolean hasNext(), T next(), void remove()
