1) Questions
    What information do we keep for each employee?

2) Find the Core objects
    - We need a base class Employee (to hold the common attributes like name, age, salary etc.)
    - A series of subclasses for each level (Respondent, Manager, Director) for the specifics of each rol.
    - !! We need a Call object to represent a call from a user. This is the main object and the whole reason of the
      call center
    - CallHandler object need to manage the lifecycle of the call, as well as the queue of calls,
      and dispatch them accordingly.

3) Relationship
    All Respondent/Manager/Director are Employees the reverse is not true.
    CallHandler object manages all Employee and Call objects

4) Actions
    ~Look at each class~
